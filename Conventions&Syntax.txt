MY THOUGHTS ON CONVENTIONS AND SYNTAX

    Even though Conventions and Syntax can be a major pain sometimes, (especially when switching between languages), 
they are incredibly important to be able to write clear, concise code that works and is readable and understandable to 
other coders. 

First, if you don't use the correct SYNTAX your program will not run.

Second, if you weren't using CONVENTIONS you could code everything on a single line. It would run, but eww...

Third, to be able to use an IF statement you are required to set up the IF statement with the correct SYNTAX or it won't run. 

Fourth, using CONVENTIONS to name your variables will allow another coder to understand what that variable is for.

Fifth, using the proper CONVENTIONS allows you to make a variable throughout your code instead of just using a number each time, 
  that way if you need to change that number you only need to change the value of the variable and it will replace it all 
  throughout the code.
