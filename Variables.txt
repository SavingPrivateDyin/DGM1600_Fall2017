MY THOUGHTS ON VARIABLES

VARIABLES are the very essence of any program you will create. I guess it is feasible to create a program without VARIABLES
but that would be a terrible pain in the rear end. 

I will break down variables below:

1. Start with and access modifier which you can set to private or public depending on what the variable will be used for. 

2. Next Delcare the type of the variable. examples: int, double, float, string, boolean.

3. Name your variable. example: private int health

4. Include "=" to set your variable. example: private int health =

5. Use correct value type you want set to your variable. example: private int health = 100;

6. Make sure to end statement with a ";"!!!!


EXAMPLE VARIABLES

private int health = 100;
public float water = 0.50f;
private string waterBottle = "not found!"
public double gas = 0.75;
public boolean gameOver = true;
