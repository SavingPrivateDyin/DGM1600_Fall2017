Switches

Switches are another way to test the state of an object. 
Switches are best used if you have multiple factors to check (If you are using multiple if statements).

examples:

public string townCenter;

		switch (townCenter){
			case "main":
				print("you are on main street dummy");
				break;
			case "state":
				print("you are on state street..... real helpful I know");
				break;
			case "blacksmith":
				print("the Blacksmith gives you a funny look. Most likely because of your clothes...");
				break;
			case "bakery":
				print("the smell alone guides you straight into the store. Before you know it you are halfway through a fresh doughnut");
				break;
			case "morgue":
				print("the smell of people rotting immediately makes you turn around");
				break;
			default:
				print("apparently you haven't even made it into the city.... lost much?");
				break;
		}

public int health = 15; 
        switch (health){
            case 100:
				print("you are perfectly healthy!");
				break;
			case 75:
				print("you are doing pretty well");
				break;
			case 50:
				print("you are halfway dead...");
				break;
			case 25:
				print("you aren't looking too good...");
				break;
			case 15:
				print("not sure how you are still walking........");
				break;
			default:
				print("bro you're dead.... sorry");
				break;
        }

public int money = 100;
    switch (money){
        case 100:
			print("you are supa rich!");
			break;
		case 50:
			print("you are doing ok");
			break;
		case 25:
			print("you aren't poor...");
			break;
		default:
			print("bro you're broke.... sorry");
			break;
    }

public int enemies = 50;
    switch (money){
        case 100:
			print("you are so screwed!");
			break;
		case 50:
			print("you have a lot of work to do");
			break;
		case 25:
			print("you probably will need health potions");
			break;
		default:
			print("bro you're be fine");
			break;
    }

public string whoDis = "your mom";

		switch (townCenter){
			case "bob":
				print("bob is busy right now, please come back");
				break;
			case "murray":
				print("you are on a city?");
				break;
			case "jill":
				print("are you looking for jack?");
				break;
			case "jack":
				print("you best run bro, jill is looking for you");
				break;
			case "your mom":
				print("momma said knock you out!!!");
				break;
			default:
				print("apparently you have no clue who the freak this is... good work");
				break;
		}
