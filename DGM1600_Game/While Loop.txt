While Loops

While loops are a to do a repetitive task many times easily. It is used over for loops usually
for 2 reasons. 1: because it there are a lot of reptitions needed or 2: you aren't sure how
many repitions are needed. 

Examples:

public int maxHealth = 100;
public int minHealth = 0;

while ( maxHealth > 0 ){
    print("your health is " + maxHealth);
    health--;
}

while ( maxHealth > 0 ){
    print("your health is " + maxHealth);
    health -= 2;
}

while ( maxHealth > 0 ){
    print("your health is " + maxHealth);
    health -= 10;
}

while ( maxHealth > 0 ){
    print("your health is " + maxHealth);
    health -= 15;
}

while ( maxHealth > 0 ){
    print("your health is " + maxHealth);
    health -= 25;
}

while ( minHealth < 100){
    print("Potion is healing for 1 point per second. Your health is: " minHealth);
    minHealth++;
}

while ( minHealth < 100){
    print("Potion is healing for 2 point per second. Your health is: " minHealth);
    minHealth += 2;
}

while ( minHealth < 100){
    print("Potion is healing for 10 point per second. Your health is: " minHealth);
    minHealth += 10;
}

while ( minHealth < 100){
    print("Potion is healing for 25 point per second. Your health is: " minHealth);
    minHealth += 25;
}
