MY THOUGHTS ON IF  STATEMENTS

If statements are extremely power tools to compare one thing or a list of things against 
one another. It allows you to split your program based on conditional items. Like if your
player gets hit with a bullet, you can decide how much damage the player takes depending
on where he is hit with if statements.

Examples:

if(sky == "blue")
if(sky == "gray")
if(sky == "black")
if(sky == "cloudy")
if(sky == "sunny")
if(sky == "rainy")
if(sky == "on fire")
if(sky == "falling")
if(sky == "soaring")

You can have multiple if statements by using else if after the first if statement.

Examples:

if(sky == "blue")
else if(sky == "gray")
else if(sky == "black")
else if(sky == "cloudy")
else if(sky == "sunny")
else if(sky == "rainy")
else if(sky == "on fire")
else if(sky == "falling")
else if(sky == "soaring")
